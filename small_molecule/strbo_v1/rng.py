"""Unified RNG helper: one seed, three deterministic sources.

A :class:`RNG` instance exposes a :class:`random.Random` (Python's
``random``), a :class:`numpy.random.Generator` (``numpy.random``), and a
:func:`torch.manual_seed` (PyTorch's global RNG) — all derived from a
single integer seed. This guarantees that the multi-objective BO loop's
candidate selection (numpy-based MC for EHVI / Chebyshev), the loop's
analogue pick order (``random.sample`` for the pool subsample), and
the GP fit (torch) all use a single reproducible stream.

Why this exists
---------------
The pre-existing :func:`bayesian_analog_search` accepted
``rng: Optional[random.Random]``. Multi-objective EHVI is a Monte-Carlo
estimate of the expected hypervolume improvement, which calls
``numpy.random`` — using the global ``numpy.random`` would break
reproducibility. ``RNG.numpy`` exposes a seeded
:class:`numpy.random.Generator` so the BO loop stays reproducible.
GPSurrogate's torch seeding was historically driven by
``GPConfig.seed`` (an int defaulting to 0); the ``RNG`` class also
exposes a :meth:`torch` helper for callers that want to re-seed torch
before fitting a GP. This is intentionally *not* automatic — the
caller (the search loop) controls when torch gets re-seeded, to avoid
surprising side effects on the GP.

Backwards-compatibility
-----------------------
A :class:`random.Random` instance is auto-promoted to :class:`RNG` at
all entry points (``bayesian_analog_search``, ``random_analog_search``,
``acquisition.expected_hypervolume_improvement``). The promotion
derives a deterministic ``SeedSequence`` from the random instance's
internal state, so pre-existing single-objective code that passes a
plain ``random.Random(seed)`` keeps working unchanged.
